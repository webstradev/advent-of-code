TDD Practice Repo
2021 Advent of Code Solvers written in Go

I have use this repository to store the code written to solve puzzles in the 2021 Advent of Code event.

**The aim of this project for me was absolutely not to complete the advent of code puzzles in the fastest time possible.**
On the contrary, it was the exact opposite, I tried to apply some of the TDD principles and practice writing tests in go. I have almost certainly overtested this project.
But then again that was the point. 

Some of the functions might seem a bit redundant and/or over the top, but I tried applying best practices and including tests and proper package management to practice some of these principles.

I have written one package for each day meaning one package would contain the solvers for 2 puzzles and the included tests.

Furthermore there is a util package which includes some helper functions used throughout the project.

This project is mainly an exercise for myself to focuss on writing clean code using some of the TDD principles, comments, tests and practice structuring out my code and building some good habits.
